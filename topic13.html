        <h3>Using CSS animations</h3>
        <p>CSS animations make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another.
            Animations consist of two components, a style describing the CSS animation and a set of keyframes that
            indicate the start and end states of the animation’s style, as well as possible intermediate waypoints.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>They’re easy to use for simple animations; you can create them without even having to know JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
                The animations run well, even under moderate system load. Simple animations can often perform poorly in
                JavaScript (unless they’re well made). The rendering engine can use frame-skipping and other techniques
                to keep the performance as smooth as possible.
            </li>
            <li>Letting the browser control the animation sequence lets the browser optimize performance and efficiency
                by, for example, reducing the update frequency of animations running in tabs that aren't currently
                visible.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To create a CSS animation sequence, you style the element you want to animate with the animation property or
            its sub-properties. This lets you configure the timing, duration, and other details of how the animation
            sequence should progress. This does not configure the actual appearance of the animation, which is done
            using the <span style="color: #ffc600">@keyframes</span> at-rule as described in Defining the animation
            sequence using keyframes below.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>The sub-properties of the animation property are:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>animation-delay <br>
                Configures the delay between the time the element is loaded and the beginning of the animation sequence.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>animation-direction <br>
                Configures whether or not the animation should alternate direction on each run through the sequence or
                reset to the start point and repeat itself.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>animation-duration <br>
                Configures the length of time that an animation should take to complete one cycle.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>animation-iteration-count <br>
                Configures the number of times the animation should repeat; you can specify infinite to repeat the
                animation indefinitely.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>animation-name <br>
                Specifies the name of the @keyframes at-rule describing the animation’s keyframes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>animation-play-state <br>
                Lets you pause and resume the animation sequence.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>animation-timing-function <br>
                Configures the timing of the animation; that is, how the animation transitions through keyframes, by
                establishing acceleration curves.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>animation-fill-mode <br>
                Configures what values are applied by the animation before and after it is executing.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you’ve configured the animation’s timing, you need to define the appearance of the animation. This is
            done by establishing two or more keyframes using the @keyframes at-rule. Each keyframe describes how the
            animated element should render at a given time during the animation sequence.</p>

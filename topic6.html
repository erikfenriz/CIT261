        <h3 class="quote">DOM</h3>
        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page
            so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as
            nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

            A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source.
            But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so
            it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified
            with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

            The W3C DOM and WHATWG DOM standards are implemented in most modern browsers. Many browsers extend the
            standard, so care must be exercised when using them on the web where documents may be accessed by various
            browsers with different DOMs.
        </p>
        <p>For example, the standard DOM specifies that the getElementsByTagName method in the code below must return a
            list of all the P elements in the document:</p>
        <pre>
            var paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("P");
// paragraphs[0] is the first <p> element
// paragraphs[1] is the second <p> element, etc.
alert(paragraphs[0].nodeName);
        </pre>

        <h3 class="quote">DOM and JavaScript</h3>
        <p>The short example above, like nearly all of the examples in this reference, is JavaScript. That is to say,
            it's written in JavaScript, but it uses the DOM to access the document and its elements. The DOM is not a
            programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web
            pages, HTML documents, XML documents, and their component parts (e.g. elements). Every element in a
            document—the document as a whole, the head, tables within the document, table headers, text within the table
            cells—is part of the document object model for that document, so they can all be accessed and manipulated
            using the DOM and a scripting language like JavaScript.

            In the beginning, JavaScript and the DOM were tightly intertwined, but eventually, they evolved into
            separate entities. The page content is stored in the DOM and may be accessed and manipulated via JavaScript,
            so that we may write this approximative equation:

            API (HTML or XML page) = DOM + JS (scripting language)

            The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural
            representation of the document available from a single, consistent API. Though we focus exclusively on
            JavaScript in this reference documentation, implementations of the DOM can be built for any language, as
            this Python example demonstrates:</p>
        <pre>
            # Python DOM example
import xml.dom.minidom as m
doc = m.parse("C:\\Projects\\Py\\chap1.xml");
doc.nodeName # DOM property of document object;
p_list = doc.getElementsByTagName("para");
        </pre>

        <h3 class="quote">Access the DOM</h3>
        <p>
            You don't have to do anything special to begin using the DOM. Different browsers have different
            implementations of the DOM, and these implementations exhibit varying degrees of conformance to the actual
            DOM standard (a subject we try to avoid in this documentation), but every web browser uses some document
            object model to make web pages accessible via JavaScript.

            When you create a script–whether it's inline in a script element or included in the web page by means of a
            script loading instruction–you can immediately begin using the API for the document or window elements to
            manipulate the document itself or to get at the children of that document, which are the various elements in
            the web page. Your DOM programming may be something as simple as the following, which displays an alert
            message by using the alert() function from the window object, or it may use more sophisticated DOM methods
            to actually create new content, as in the longer example below.

            This following JavaScript will display an alert when the document is loaded (and when the whole DOM is
            available for use).

        </p>
        <pre>&#x3c;body onload="window.alert('Welcome to my home page!');"></pre>
        <p>This function creates a new H1 element, adds text to that element, and then adds the H1 to the tree for this
            document:
        </p>
        <pre>
            &#x3c;html>
  &#x3c;head>
    &#x3c;script>
       // run this function when the document is loaded
       window.onload = function() {

           // create a couple of elements in an otherwise empty HTML page
           var heading = document.createElement("h1");
           var heading_text = document.createTextNode("Big Head!");
           heading.appendChild(heading_text);
           document.body.appendChild(heading);
       }
    &#x3c;/script>
  &#x3c;/head>
  &#x3c;body>
  &#x3c;/body>
&#x3c;/html>

        </pre>
        <h3 class="quote">Data Types</h3>
        <p>This reference tries to describe the various objects and types in simple terms. But there are a number of
            different data types being passed around the API that you should be aware of. For the sake of simplicity,
            syntax examples in this API reference typically refer to nodes as elements, to arrays of nodes as nodeLists
            (or simply elements), and to attribute nodes simply as attributes.

            The following table briefly describes these data types.</p>
        <table>

            <tr style="background-color: moccasin">
                <td>document</td>
                <td>When a member returns an object of type document (e.g., the ownerDocument property of an element
                    returns the document to which it belongs), this object is the root document object itself. The DOM
                    document Reference chapter describes the document object.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr style="background-color: paleturquoise">
                <td>element</td>
                <td>element refers to an element or a node of type element returned by a member of the DOM API. Rather
                    than saying, for example, that the document.createElement() method returns an object reference to a
                    node, we just say that this method returns the element that has just been created in the DOM.
                    element objects implement the DOM Element interface and also the more basic Node interface, both of
                    which are included together in this reference.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr style="background-color: salmon">
                <td>nodeList</td>
                <td>A nodeList is an array of elements, like the kind that is returned by the method
                    document.getElementsByTagName(). Items in a nodeList are accessed by index in either of two ways:
                    list.item(1)
                    list[1]
                    These two are equivalent. In the first, item() is the single method on the nodeList object. The
                    latter uses the typical array syntax to fetch the second item in the list.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr style="background-color: beige">
                <td>attribute</td>
                <td>When an attribute is returned by a member (e.g., by the createAttribute() method), it is an object
                    reference that exposes a special (albeit small) interface for attributes. Attributes are nodes in
                    the DOM just like elements are, though you may rarely use them as such.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr style="background-color: lavender">
                <td>namedNodeMap</td>
                <td>A namedNodeMap is like an array, but the items are accessed by name or index, though this latter
                    case is merely a convenience for enumeration, as they are in no particular order in the list. A
                    namedNodeMap has an item() method for this purpose, and you can also add and remove items from a
                    namedNodeMap.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3 class="quote">DOM interfaces</h3>
        <p>This guide is about the objects and the actual things you can use to manipulate the DOM hierarchy. There are
            many points where understanding how these work can be confusing. For example, the object representing the
            HTML form element gets its name property from the HTMLFormElement interface but its className property from
            the HTMLElement interface. In both cases, the property you want is simply in that form object.

            But the relationship between objects and the interfaces that they implement in the DOM can be confusing, and
            so this section attempts to say a little something about the actual interfaces in the DOM specification and
            how they are made available.</p>
        <strong>Interfaces and Objects</strong>
        <p>Many objects borrow from several different interfaces. The table object, for example, implements a
            specialized HTML Table Element Interface, which includes such methods as createCaption and insertRow. But
            since it's also an HTML element, table implements the Element interface described in the DOM element
            Reference chapter. And finally, since an HTML element is also, as far as the DOM is concerned, a node in the
            tree of nodes that make up the object model for an HTML or XML page, the table object also implements the
            more basic Node interface, from which Element derives.

            When you get a reference to a table object, as in the following example, you routinely use all three of
            these interfaces interchangeably on the object, perhaps without knowing it.</p>
        <pre>var table = document.getElementById("table");
var tableAttrs = table.attributes; // Node/Element interface
for (var i = 0; i < tableAttrs.length; i++) {
  // HTMLTableElement interface: border attribute
  if(tableAttrs[i].nodeName.toLowerCase() == "border")
    table.border = "1";
}
// HTMLTableElement interface: summary attribute
table.summary = "note: increased border";</pre>
        <strong>Core Interfaces in the DOM</strong>
        <p>This section lists some of the most commonly-used interfaces in the DOM. The idea is not to describe what
            these APIs do here but to give you an idea of the sorts of methods and properties you will see very often as
            you use the DOM. These common APIs are used in the longer examples in the DOM Examples chapter at the end of
            this book.

            Document and window objects are the objects whose interfaces you generally use most often in DOM
            programming. In simple terms, the window object represents something like the browser, and the document
            object is the root of the document itself. Element inherits from the generic Node interface, and together
            these two interfaces provide many of the methods and properties you use on individual elements. These
            elements may also have specific interfaces for dealing with the kind of data those elements hold, as in the
            table object example in the previous section. </p>

        <p>The following is a brief list of common APIs in web and XML page scripting using the DOM.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>document.getElementById(id)</li>
            <li>document.getElementsByTagName(name)</li>
            <li>document.createElement(name)</li>
            <li>parentNode.appendChild(node)</li>
            <li>element.innerHTML</li>
            <li>element.style.left</li>
            <li>element.setAttribute()</li>
            <li>element.getAttribute()</li>
            <li>element.addEventListener()</li>
            <li>window.content</li>
            <li>window.onload</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Testing the DOM API</strong>
        <p>This document provides samples for every interface that you can use in your own web development. In some
            cases, the samples are complete HTML pages, with the DOM access in a &#x3c;script> element, the interface
            (e.g, buttons) necessary to fire up the script in a form, and the HTML elements upon which the DOM operates
            listed as well. When this is the case, you can cut and paste the example into a new HTML document, save it,
            and run the example from the browser.

            There are some cases, however, when the examples are more concise. To run examples that only demonstrate the
            basic relationship of the interface to the HTML elements, you may want to set up a test page in which
            interfaces can be easily accessed from scripts. The following very simple web page provides a &#x3c;script>
            element in the header in which you can place functions that test the interface, a few HTML elements with
            attributes that you can retrieve, set, or otherwise manipulate, and the web user interface necessary to call
            those functions from the browser.

            You can use this test page or create a similar one to test the DOM interfaces you are interested in and see
            how they work on the browser platform. You can update the contents of the test() function as needed, create
            more buttons, or add elements as necessary.</p>

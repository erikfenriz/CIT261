    <p class="quote">In computer science, the syntax of a computer language is the set of rules that defines
        the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment
        in that language. This applies both to programming languages, where the document represents source code,
        and markup languages, where the document represents data. The syntax of a language defines its surface form. <a

    <p class="quote">JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties,
        and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in
        which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can
        define your own objects. All objects in JavaScript are descended from Object;
        all objects inherit methods and properties from Object.prototype, although they may be overridden.

    <p class="quote">JSON is a syntax for serializing objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null. It is based
        upon JavaScript syntax but is distinct from it: some JavaScript is not JSON, and some JSON is not
        JavaScript.The JSON object contains methods for parsing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and converting values
        to JSON. It
        can't be called or constructed, and aside from its two method properties, it has no interesting functionality of
        its own. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON">MDN web

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vGQxKDC99M">Evidence for Fluency</a>
    <p class="quote">The read-only localStorage property allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's
        origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions. localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that
        while data stored in localStorage has no expiration time, data stored in sessionStorage gets cleared when the
        page session ends â€” that is, when the page is closed.

    <p class="quote">Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system
        tells you about so you can respond to them in some way if desired. For example if the user clicks a button on a
        webpage, you might want to respond to that action by displaying an information box. In this article we will
        discuss some important concepts surrounding events, and look at how they work in browsers. This won't be an
        exhaustive study; just what you need to know at this stage.

    <img src="img/topic10.png" alt="programming" width="300">
    <a href="https://youtu.be/2LhL1Af1zB0">Evidence for Fluency</a>
    <p class="quote">HTML5 has come up with several new features including video, audio, and canvas tags.
        HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts. It
        is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of
        technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. This set is
        sometimes called HTML5 & friends and often shortened to just HTML5.

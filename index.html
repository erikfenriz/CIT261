    <p class="quote">In computer science, the syntax of a computer language is the set of rules that defines
        the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment
        in that language. This applies both to programming languages, where the document represents source code,
        and markup languages, where the document represents data. The syntax of a language defines its surface form. <a

    <p class="quote">JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties,
        and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in
        which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can
        define your own objects. All objects in JavaScript are descended from Object;
        all objects inherit methods and properties from Object.prototype, although they may be overridden.

    <img src="img/topic3.png" alt="programming" width="300">
    <p class="quote">JSON is a syntax for serializing objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null. It is based
        upon JavaScript syntax but is distinct from it: some JavaScript is not JSON, and some JSON is not
        JavaScript.The JSON object contains methods for parsing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and converting values to JSON. It
        can't be called or constructed, and aside from its two method properties, it has no interesting functionality of
        its own. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON">MDN web

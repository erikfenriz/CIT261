    <h2>Topic#1</h2>

    <h3 class="quote">Variables</h3>

    <p>Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide
        a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and
        ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information.</p>

    <p>It is important to declare the variables used in the program (if global) or function (if local) on top and use
        them later. It makes it easier for
        maintaining, and considered a best practice.</p>
    <br>
    <pre>
        var car, bus, pedestrian;
        function myFunction(){
        var first, second, i, y, x;
        // ... do something
        }
    </pre>
    <br>
    <p>With the EcmaScript 6 version it is also better to pick <span style="color: brown">let</span> or <span
            style="color: brown">const.</span><br>
        <strong>Let</strong> has block scope whereas <strong>var</strong> has function scope. Using let instead of var
        means using the variables in the place where they were declared which produces the less prone to error code.</p>
    <p><strong>Const.</strong>The const keyword was introduced in es6 to allow immutable variables. That is, variables
        whose value cannot be modified once assigned.</p>
    <p><strong>Hoisting.</strong>Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved
        to the top of their scope before code execution.

    </p>
    <p><strong>Assigning value:</strong></p>
    <pre>
        let x, y z;
        x = 10
        for (y = 0; x < something; y++){
        // ... do something
        }
    </pre>

        <h3 class="quote">Report</h3>

        <p>&emsp;&emsp;We all draw our goals from desires that are conditioned by various life circumstances. My life
            circumstances
            taught me a wide variety of skills and disciplines but I was not a specialist of any kind before having a
            strong desire to become a software engineer making myself involved in the development of the 21<sup>st</sup>
            century.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;In Azerbaijan when I was a kid, I used to be a piano player in the Republican Gymnasium. In
            Russia, I became a student of a discipline called a regional scientist. Shortly after I became a
            photographer and worked with movie companies. I became a Mormon. Then I enrolled at a music school. Why I
            made all these choices? Short answer: my brain is puzzled this way. A bit longer: I learned what I need to
            learn to compensate ignorance.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Music helped me a lot. It is a form, sense, touch, controlled and uncontrolled emotions and it
            is all because of the hertz that sounds in a certain sequence over time that triggers water inside of our
            bodies. Also, it greatly disciplines its followers.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Becoming a regional scientist wasn’t my direct intention and I quit the university in a year. I
            chose that major to become better at English, learn French, history, and see what kind of people go there.
            My English wasn’t good and I learned it mainly by watching YouTube and catching the most used patterns of
            the language. I managed to pass the first test and was accepted to an advanced English group. This is an
            important principle I try to follow: even if I don’t fit by the level of expertise, I will still try to
            demonstrate that I have this experience.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;For a while, I was taking a role of a photographer but that was just a desire to be an artist,
            to extend the way I see colors of the world, to see the perspective and the beauty with my own eyes.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;I compensated the desire to learn the Bible by becoming a Mormon. I was very inquisitive and
            missionaries were happy to talk. I was a pantheist and through talks and learning, I managed to feel what
            religious people feel. Religious experience is also a part of education. Unfortunately, everywhere in the
            world people are taught those great pillars of the culture incorrectly. The knowledge is still concentrated
            to please the rich and enslave slaves.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;I lived in Saint Petersburg and the stake I was in had a baby grand with the brand name KAWAI.
            And the sound of it was truly beautiful just like its name but I couldn’t play as I have not played the
            piano for more than ten years. I played as if I was a kid that touched the piano for the first time. I was
            not upset. I knew that the neural connections of a piano player were weakened, but since I knew that they
            were once there, I knew they could be restored. I saw that playing the piano is just a mechanical movement
            of the fingers, tempo, notes in the form of grammar and some other less interesting details. I knew that if
            I communicate with musicians and go to the Philharmonic very often, I will plunge into the academic music
            environment so deeply that my brain would think that this is my survival system and will try to do
            everything to build the neurons that I need. Thus, in 4 months, from a complete zero, I passed an audition
            and got into a local music school. The principal called me ‘talented’ and gave me the best teacher in the
            school. I quit in 6 months because they couldn’t teach me the way I could teach myself.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;I also taught myself Korean, Japanese, and French. One day I knew how to speak in Azerbaijani. I
            don’t
            speak all these languages now but they taught me the ways of different thinking. I also taught myself
            philosophy and linguistics at the same time which increased my understanding of different nationalities
            greatly.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Thanks to the amateur study of scientific disciplines I have become much better at understanding
            world politics; the struggle for leadership in the world of wildlife and what causes this process is easily
            extrapolated to the society of the present.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Thus, thanks to Chaos theory, I learned how to think almost like a scientist but I couldn’t
            apply all the knowledge about learning and unify everything that I learned.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;When it was the time to choose a major for admission, the answer was: something very hard that
            requires a lot of thinking, science related, strong discipline, modern, and what I can do daily everywhere
            (I can’t afford a laboratory for experiments). If it was not programming but something else, I would choose
            that discipline. Nevertheless, the world’s culture has developed the way that the specialty software
            engineering was the choice I made at that time and in that place.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Before I started, I read a ton of articles with one shared opinion that this skill is not like
            any other skill. That programming is hard. I disagree. It is like absolutely any other skill. It has the
            same approach as the piano playing, which requires a lot of practice and thinking, or learning a new
            language, which requires discipline and maintenance of many skills at once (reading, writing, speaking).
            These skills also share the curse of white spaces in experience since to develop a skill isn’t enough to
            study 6 months and being a passionate prodigy. The same is true about programming.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;I learned that a brain learns new skills almost identically. When we learn something new, we
            start the mechanism of reactions to absorb information. When we become more experienced, we might start
            thinking that the invested time hadn’t paid yet which launches the mechanism of anxiety and devastation that
            are usually packed with skills that we learn for survival purposes (getting a job, moving to another
            country). We also feel fear due to everlasting failure. I know that feeling as a former pianist and it is
            absolutely the same. And this is what unites every skill we learn, it is fear and a long-lasting failure
            stage that we strive to compensate. It is commonly known that people who have achieved something are bold
            but, thus, those who cannot learn something are not stupid, but simply mentally weak and cannot even
            overcome themselves since learning something new always involves fear and failure. We were not taught about
            it in schools.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;To overcome fear, I decided to do a lot of programming and get a feeling that I am capable of
            handling three programming classes during this semester; self-confidence is half the battle.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;I won’t praise this class. It is poorly organized; misleading, the mobile development that isn’t
            a mobile development, JavaScript class that has 75% of term project’s grade for CSS, team members that care
            only about their grades, team presentations that cannot teach how to code nor how to think.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Nevertheless, it has some core values that cannot be underestimated. It teaches how to learn new
            things and I have never seen anything like it anywhere. Learning how to learn is the core of learning – such
            global principles people need to catch from their parents, not universities. Unfortunately, knowledge is
            still the prerogative of a narrow number of people. Since “Knowledge is power”, people do not rush to share
            it.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;At the end of the semester, I am sure that I learned the lesson. Getting self-awareness in
            programming was my first objective when I chose classes. Now I am ready to do tests for employers easily.
            Also, my team currently started working on WordPress, CMS that is dependent on the PHP programming language
            which I do not know but still I understand what is going on. I can find and absorb any type of information
            while sitting calmly in front of a Mac.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;About being calm: not long before I tried to learn skills using a mobile nervous system. It
            requires a lot of energy. With active nerves, information is recorded as a stress (during failure stage) and
            as happiness (during achievements). It worked for some time but then my body started to reject stress, it
            wanted to save its energy. I overused the technique but thanks to yoga I found the way to learn peacefully.
            This is where academics and practices like yoga meet each other; universities teach us to learn and be
            executive whilst yoga teaches how to relax, deep thinking, and body control.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;This class taught me not only about the new technologies but also how it is important to have
            bright brains in a team; people who are free from shackles. That it is important to have the right to choose
            with whom I want to work with. I need to know from where people came, what is their background, how wide is
            their thinking, and how they solve problems. I do not want to waste time on those who tend to throw their
            work on others but still want to get good grades, income, and prestige without having liabilities.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;The low level of self-consciousness and self-analysis among students is the most problematic
            part of many groups. The students can’t simply identify their roles in teams to achieve better results
            together. The university doesn’t teach us how to adapt to such situations and thus students choose more
            comfortable and energy-saving models.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Maybe it worth considering an Island 101 class where students will be forced to stay on the same
            island during the semester and their progress will be based on the quality of teamwork. Otherwise, the
            motivation to work is based only on the loss of money and getting bad grades. Is it a good motivation?
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;In the world of engineering and development, we need to choose right models and understand our
            roles better and how we can improve ourselves and the world around. We must shift away from “fit the
            requirements” kind of education. The universities need to teach students how to solve real life today’s
            problems, not a hypothetical development of something. Thus, students will choose right models because they
            will be expected to collaborate equally and get the direct evaluation by a professor that organizes the
            process and makes changes if those are needed just like it would be a Ph.D. level of education.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;I have stopped caring about the grades. The only what matters is the experience that raises
            maturity and awareness. Grades are just another type of encouragement and punishment mechanism that is based
            on fear. When the mankind stops relying on monkey’s reactions and starts developing humans like they really
            have bright brains and can learn absolutely everything, we will get another technological revolution faster
            than businesses and politicians get a chance to make a money on the progress we make. Maybe it would be a
            call for changing the established order of society, which stretches from ancient Greece and Rome.

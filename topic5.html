        <h3 class="quote">Local Storage API</h3>
        <p>The Web Storage API provides mechanisms by which browsers can securely store key/value pairs, in a much more
            intuitive fashion than using cookies. This article provides a walkthrough of how to make use of this simple
            technology.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Basics</strong></p>
        <p>Storage objects are simple key-value stores, similar to objects, but they stay intact through page loads. The
            keys and the values are always strings (note that integer keys will be automatically converted to strings,
            just like what objects do). You can access these values like an object, or with the Storage.getItem() and
            Storage.setItem() methods. These three lines all set the colorSetting entry in the same way:
        </p>
        <pre>
            localStorage.colorSetting = '#a4509b';
            localStorage['colorSetting'] = '#a4509b';
            localStorage.setItem('colorSetting', '#a4509b');
        </pre>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> It's recommended to use the Web Storage API (setItem, getItem, removeItem, key,
            length) to prevent
            the pitfalls associated with using plain objects as key-value stores.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>sessionStorage maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration
                of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores).
            </li>
            <li>localStorage does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These mechanisms are available via the Window.sessionStorage and Window.localStorage properties (to be more
            precise, in supporting browsers the Window object implements the WindowLocalStorage and WindowSessionStorage
            objects, which the localStorage and sessionStorage properties hang off) — invoking one of these will create
            an instance of the Storage object, through which data items can be set, retrieved, and removed. A different
            Storage object is used for the sessionStorage and localStorage for each origin — they function and are
            controlled separately.
        </p>
        <h3 class="quote">Getting values from storage</h3>
        <p>Values can be retrieved from storage using Storage.getItem(). This takes the key of the data
            item as an argument, and returns the data value. For example:</p>
        <pre>function setStyles() {
  var currentColor = localStorage.getItem('bgcolor');
  var currentFont = localStorage.getItem('font');
  var currentImage = localStorage.getItem('image');

  document.getElementById('bgcolor').value = currentColor;
  document.getElementById('font').value = currentFont;
  document.getElementById('image').value = currentImage;

  htmlElem.style.backgroundColor = '#' + currentColor;
  pElem.style.fontFamily = currentFont;
  imgElem.setAttribute('src', currentImage);
}</pre>
        <p>Here, the first three lines grab the values from local storage. Next, we set the values displayed in the form
            elements to those values, so that they keep in sync when you reload the page. Finally, we update the
            styles/decorative image on the page, so your customization options come up again on reload.</p>
        <h3 class="quote">Setting values in storage</h3>
        <p>Storage.setItem() is used both to create new data items, and (if the data item already exists) update
            existing values. This takes two arguments — the key of the data item to create/modify, and the value to
            store in it.</p>
        <pre>function populateStorage() {
  localStorage.setItem('bgcolor', document.getElementById('bgcolor').value);
  localStorage.setItem('font', document.getElementById('font').value);
  localStorage.setItem('image', document.getElementById('image').value);

  setStyles();
}</pre>
        <p>The populateStorage() function sets three items in local storage — the background color, font, and image
            path. It then runs the setStyles() function to update the page styles, etc.

            We've also included an onchange handler on each form element so that the data and styling are updated
            whenever a form value is changed:</p>
        <pre>bgcolorForm.onchange = populateStorage;
fontForm.onchange = populateStorage;
imageForm.onchange = populateStorage;</pre>
        <h3 class="quote">Responding to storage changes with the StorageEvent</h3>
        <p>The StorageEvent is fired whenever a change is made to the Storage object (note that this event is not fired
            for sessionStorage changes). This won't work on the same page that is making the changes — it is really a
            way for other pages on the domain using the storage to sync any changes that are made. Pages on other
            domains can't access the same storage objects.

            On the events page (see events.js) the only JavaScript is as follows:</p>
        <pre>window.addEventListener('storage', function(e) {
  document.querySelector('.my-key').textContent = e.key;
  document.querySelector('.my-old').textContent = e.oldValue;
  document.querySelector('.my-new').textContent = e.newValue;
  document.querySelector('.my-url').textContent = e.url;
  document.querySelector('.my-storage').textContent = JSON.stringify(e.storageArea);
});</pre>
        <p>Here we add an event listener to the window object that fires when the Storage object associated with the
            current origin is changed. As you can see above, the event object associated with this event has a number of
            properties containing useful information — the key of the data that changed, the old value before the
            change, the new value after that change, the URL of the document that changed the storage, and the storage
            object itself (which we've stringified so you can see its content).</p>
        <h3 class="quote">Deleting data records</h3>
        <p>Web Storage also provides a couple of simple methods to remove data. We don't use these in our demo, but they
            are very simple to add to your project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Storage.removeItem() takes a single argument — the key of the data item you want to remove — and removes
                it from the storage object for that domain.
            </li>
            <li>Storage.clear() takes no arguments, and simply empties the entire storage object for that domain.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is the simple test section to store data in Local Storage. Local Storage is accessed by pressing option
            + CMD + i on a Mac in resources.</p>
        <form action="set">
            <input id="saveData" type="text">
            <button type="button" onclick="set()">Clicker</button>
        </form>
        <p>It saves the data to local storage and prevents the data in input from getting lost.</p>
